## 🌟 Problem Statement

The Rohini Foundation organizes oral health camps and provides essential dental care and education to thousands of children annually. However, doctors often face challenges in:

- **Recording patient data in low-network areas**
- **Efficiently generating reports**
- **Tracking camp effectiveness**
- **Managing inventory and volunteer data**

## 🚀 Our Solution

### 🎤 Voice-to-Text AI (Offline-friendly)

- Doctors can **voice-record** their observations and prescriptions.
- Our **AI model** converts voice to text and generates:
  - Patient details
  - Identified health issues
  - Criticality analysis
  - Prescriptions and guidelines
  - Diet and follow-up instructions
  - Doctor's signature

### 📊 Admin Dashboard
- A **real-time dashboard** to visualize:
  - Camp success rates
  - Total patients treated
  - Regional insights and demographics
- **Three-layered categorization** for decision-making and reporting.

### 🏕️ Camp Details Visualization
- Individual camp metrics and insights:
  - Patient improvement stats
  - Resource usage
  - Volunteer engagement
- Integrated with **Gemini AI** for smart data interpretation.

### 📩 Volunteer Registration Form
- A form to register volunteers and collect data.
- Helps:
  - Reanalyze student health trends
  - Determine inventory requirements
  - Track reconsultation needs
